# Decay Theme <img src="https://github.com/decaycs/vscode/raw/HEAD/assets/main.png" align="right" width="400px"/>
## INFORMATION
Decay uses shades of green along with a dark-toned background for better contrast!

The contrast between background and primary color helps avoiding any eye fatigue when spending a lot of time in front of the computer.
